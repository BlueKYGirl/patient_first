# Patient First
## TE Final Capstone  
Technology has had a huge impact on todayâ€™s healthcare, and not just in diagnosis and treatment; the way doctors and patients communicate with each other has changed thanks to healthcare management applications. Patients want to be able to find new doctors, see their current doctors, and schedule appointments from the convenience of their devices. Doctors want to be able to manage their offices, set their schedules, and see their daily slate of appointments and incoming patients from both their office desktops and their devices. Our application, Patient First, helps patients and doctors to work better together, putting patients first.
